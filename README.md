#### About the project
Stellar Shootout is a simple game written in Java as my final project in my computer science class during my sophomore year of high school. The objective of the game is to last as many rounds of alien invasions as possible, and will get progressively more difficult the longer one lasts. The graphics for this game was created using a pixel art editor known as [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).
